Sakana Quest
=

Sakana Quest is an adventure system that combines open-world exploration, complex puzzle battles, and survival mechanisms into a deep and sprawling world full of myths and legends, ancient civilizations and relics, economic and political strife, and mysteries to discover.

## Themes ##
The world of Sakana Quest is filled with fish (sakana = fish in Japanese). But not the kind of fish people may be used to. The various areas, cities, towns, villages, tribes, and biomes are home to a combination of mechanical and organic creatures; most of which are fish, or fish-like. If it's a fluid, there are fish that can live/swim in it. There is no magic in the world of Sakana Quest, though there is a wealth of technology (primitive -> ancient -> modern -> advanced).

### The Angler Society ###
The Angler Society is an ancient organization with a deep history. After many growing pains, the Angler Society evolved into an organization aimed at scientific discovery, conservation, and social good. They are mostly self-funded, through a combination of trusts, a parent-child "tax" system for each for-profit company that spawns from the R&D efforts of the Hook and Bait Branch, and donations from individuals and organizations. For millenia, they have sent members of the Hook and Bait Branch to explore Terra Pescaria. So much of our modern technology is due to advancements made by these brave groups of women and men. And the cost has been heavy; the Angler Society, in an effort to be more transparent, has provided statistics on H&B's abysmally high death rates for field members for the past 214 years. In short, fewer than 0.1% of the people have returned safely to Angler Society HQ from Terra Pescaria over that period, translating into about 27 people over the past 200+ years, and, though we're only guessing, probably a few hundred more if we include all expeditions from three or four thousand years ago to now. As a result, the Angler Society has marked Terra Pescaria as forbidden to all but the explorers of the Hook and Bait Branch.

#### Branches ####
There are four branches of the Angler Society: The Pole Branch, The Reel Branch, The Line Branch, and The Hook and Bait Branch.

##### The Pole Branch #####
The Pole Branch is the body that governs the rest. It's the legislative branch of the organization, where the elected members debate and determine how to allocate funds to support the various regions and their fellow anglers.

##### The Reel Branch #####
The Reel Branch is the body that ensures that the governing body is working in the best interests of the people.

##### The Line Branch #####
The Line Branch is where the majority of the population exists. To fit the metaphor created by the ancient anglers, the line is cast in the direction the pole desires, but the reel can bring the line back if it has been cast too far, or in an unexpected or problematic direction by overriding the choices of the Pole. The people choose their leaders and hope that the elected members of the Pole are both strong and flexible, and have the foresight to cast them (and the funds) in prosperous directions.

##### The Hook and Bait Branch #####
The Hook and Bait Branch is where most of the Development and Research, respectively, occur. It's also where the explorers are recruited and trained, as many of the explorers are research scientists and biomimicry engineers who do field work.

## Background & Story ##
Terra Pescaria is a continent that is a forbidden to anyone other than the explorers of the Angler Society due to very low return rates of explorers. And those who have returned share tales of places and creatures so remarkable that they excite the imagination. Terra Pescaria is the most alluring mystery of them all, and has led to a flurry of rumors, conspiracy theories, and, of course, media products (books, movies, comics, and even games).
