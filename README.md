Sakana Quest
=

Sakana Quest is an adventure system that combines open-world exploration, complex puzzle battles, survival, and discovery.

## Themes ##
The world of Sakana Quest is filled with fish (sakana = fish in Japanese). But not the kind of fish people may be used to. The various areas, cities, towns, villages, tribes, and biomes are home to a combination of mechanical and organic creatures; most of which are fish, or fish-like. There is no magic in the world of Sakana Quest, though there is a wealth of technology (primitive -> ancient -> modern -> advanced).

## Story ##
Terra Pescaria is a continent that is a forbidden to anyone other than the explorers of the Angler Society (see the hook and bait branches). At face value, this has entirely to do with conservation and safety concerns; Terra Pescaria is largely unexplored and rumors place great danger there. As such, the Angler Society's Pole Branch

### The Angler Society ###
There are four branches of the Angler Society: The Pole Branch, The Reel Branch, The Line Branch, and The Hook and Bait Branch.

##### The Pole Branch #####
The Pole Branch is the body that governs the rest. It's the legislative branch of the organization, where the elected members debate and determine how to allocate funds to support the various regions and their fellow anglers.

##### The Reel Branch #####
The Reel Branch is the body that ensures that the governing body is working in the best interests of the people.

##### The Line Branch #####
The Line Branch is where the majority of the population exists. To fit the metaphor created by the ancient anglers, the line is cast in the direction the pole desires, but the reel can bring the line back if it has been cast too far, or in an unexpected or problematic direction by overriding the choices of the Pole. The people choose their leaders and hope that the elected members of the Pole are both strong and flexible, and have the foresight to cast them (and the funds) in prosperous directions.

##### The Hook and Bait Branch #####
The Hook and Bait Branch is where most of the Development and Research, respectively, occur. It's also where the explorers are recruited and trained, as many of the explorers are research scientists and biomimicry engineers who do field work.
